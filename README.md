## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains over 2000 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

Steps of how to make a page using laravel 
1. Create a Controller
In Laravel, you can create a controller using the
make : controller Artisan command. For example, to create a
controller named PostContr011er, you would navigate to
your project directory in the terminal and run:
bash
php artisan make : controller Postcontroller
This command will create a new controller file at
app/Http/Controllers/PostController.php.

2. Defining Methods in Controller
Inside your controller, you can define methods that correspond
to various actions your application can perform. For example,
to display a list of posts, you might define a index method:
php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
class Postcontroller extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        return view('posts. index')
    }
}

3. Create a Blade File
Laravel uses the Blade templating engine for its views.In this
example, the index method is returning a view named
posts. index. This corresponds to a Blade file at
resources/views/posts/index. blade. php. You would
create this file and define your HTML markup there.

4. Setting Up the Route
Finally, you would define a route in your routes file that points
to the index action of your PostContr011er. The routes file
will be at routes/web. php. Here's an example of what the
route might look like:
php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;
use App\Http\Contr011ers\PostContr011er;


Route: ' /postsâ€¢ , [Postcontroller: :class,
index' ] ) ;


In this route definition, when a GET request is made to the
/posts URL of your application, Laravel will direct that request
to the index method of PostContr011er.

That's the basic process of setting up a route in Laravel!. Remember to run php artisan serve to start your local development server and see your routes in action.
